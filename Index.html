 <h1>Nico Botticelli</h1>
 <p>My name is Nico, I live in the city of Chicago and was born in Summer and I am currently attending Gems World Academy Chicago.</p>
<p>Hobbies: One of my hobbies is playing video games in my spare time. One of my other hobbies is pokemon card collecting. I am an excellent swimmer and am on the Latin swim team. One thing I am espically good at is story telling. Ever since I was young I have always been good at telling stories and a second career I have secertly wanted is to make movies and tv shows. My first career choice is to be an astromener and study the vast expanse of space. As a kid I loved the planets and have always wondered whats up there and how can we get there. I also collect colletibles like pokemon cards, beyblade, and action figures.</p>

<p>The first project I am going to show you is my fusion charater. I have always loved cartoons as a kid and wished I was a better drawer so I could make my own one day. I started drawing these fusion charaters to help me pratice. This fusion is called super sayian Pikachu. I have always liked drawing even if the majority of my drawing's don't come out the way I want them to. Another project I would like to show you is my political cartoon that I made in my social studies class. This cartoon describes in an analogy, that the alt-right is targeting college student join their racist ways. These two projects don't look like much but I have contributed time and effort into these two projects. I am a student that puts time and effor into my projects wheater I like them or not I will always do the work. The adodbe pages that are under this messages include work I have done the will benefit the enviroment.</p>
